# TQT_GBM_2
With the departure of 2 of our QuantConnect Open Quant League participants TQT introduces its first ever:
# Triton Quantitative Trading - In house Competition:
## Format: 
## Backtesting competition | Individual | 1 week long | Daily Scoreboard Updates | Top 2 get a spot in Quant League 
* Ex: you come up with a algorithm and backtest it during the last 6 months (arbitrary time) Submit the algorithm, we backtest it in a consistent random time period (ex: 2012)
* To stop you from overfitting the model, we will update the scoreboard everyday with you financial metrics only (that way you cant figure out what time period we are backtesting on)
### Goal?: Build the more robust algorithm in an unknown out of sample period. Any U.S asset class + financial derivatives allowed
#### What data do you have? -- U.S Fundamental Data: QuantConnects data covers 8,000 US Equities, starts in January 1998
